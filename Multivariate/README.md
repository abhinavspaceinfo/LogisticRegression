## Multivariate Logistic regression for Machine Learning
In this logistic regression, multiple variables will use. As we can see there are many variables to classify “Churn”.

## Telecom Churn use case
So now we will be building a logistic regression model with telecom churn use case.

There is a company ‘X‘ they earn most of the revenue through using voice and internet services. And this company maintains information about the customer.

Information regarding
Demographics
Service Availed
Expences
There other information they are maintaining and they want to understand customer behavior. They wanted to know whether the customer would churn.

So now lets start and build a model which will tell us whether customer will churn or not. Churn means the customer will switch to other telecom operator.
