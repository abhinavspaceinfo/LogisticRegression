## Simple Univariate Logistice regression 

### This code is just a demonstration of Univariate Logistice regression with 20 records dataset.
Let's now look at how logistic regression is implemented in python.
In python, logistic regression can be implemented using libraries such as sklearn and statsmodels, though looking at the coefficients and the model summary is easier using statsmodels. 
You can find the optimum values of β0 and β1 using this python code.
